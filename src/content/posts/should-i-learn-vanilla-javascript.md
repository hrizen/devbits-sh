JavaScript is one of the most widely used programming languages, powering everything from small interactive elements to large-scale web applications. But when you’re starting out, you might wonder: should you learn “vanilla” JavaScript first, or jump straight to a framework like React, Vue, or Angular?

## What Is Vanilla JavaScript?

Vanilla JavaScript simply means the core language without any frameworks or libraries. It’s the raw form of JavaScript that runs directly in browsers.

Example of vanilla JavaScript to add a click event:

```javascript
document.getElementById('myBtn').addEventListener('click', function () {
  alert('Button clicked!')
})
```

## Reasons to Learn Vanilla JavaScript First

### 1. Strong Foundation

Frameworks are built on top of JavaScript. Understanding the underlying language makes it easier to learn and troubleshoot frameworks later.

### 2. No Abstraction Gaps

When something goes wrong, knowing vanilla JS helps you debug without relying solely on framework-specific tools.

### 3. Transferable Skills

JavaScript fundamentals like the DOM, events, and async programming are universal across frameworks.

### 4. Lightweight Projects

Not every project needs a full framework. Small sites often benefit from a minimal JavaScript approach.

## Reasons to Start with a Framework

### 1. Faster to Build Complex Apps

Frameworks handle routing, state management, and UI updates for you.

### 2. Industry Demand

Many job postings list frameworks like React or Vue as required skills.

### 3. Developer Ecosystem

Frameworks offer large communities, plugins, and tooling that accelerate development.

## Recommended Approach

**Learn enough vanilla JavaScript to be comfortable with:**

- Variables and data types
- Functions and scope
- DOM manipulation
- Event handling
- Fetch API for HTTP requests
- Basic ES6+ features (arrow functions, `let`/`const`, template literals)

Then, move on to a framework of your choice. This balance gives you core skills while preparing you for modern development.

## Example Progression Path

1. Build small projects in vanilla JS — to-do list, form validation, simple games.
2. Learn ES6+ features deeply.
3. Move to a framework (React, Vue, or Angular).
4. Revisit vanilla JS for advanced concepts like closures, prototypes, and performance optimization.

## Final Thoughts

You don’t need to master every corner of vanilla JS before touching a framework, but having a strong grasp of fundamentals will make you a better, more adaptable developer. Frameworks come and go, but JavaScript is here to stay.
